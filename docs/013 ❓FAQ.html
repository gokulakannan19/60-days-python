<p><strong>Q1</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;How does the for-loop work?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;The for-loop executes the indented lines <em>n-</em>times, where <em>n</em> is the number of items in the list that is being iterated.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Q2: What is the difference between a while loop and a for-loop?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;A&nbsp;while loop iterates as long as the while-condition is True. A for-loop iterates that many times as there are items in the list that is being iterated. </p><p><strong>Q3:&nbsp;What are some other examples when we would need to use a for-loop?</strong></p><p>A:&nbsp;A for-loop is generally needed when you want to perform the same manipulation on multiple objects (e.g., capitalizing strings of a list). Another example of when you would need to use a for-loop is if you wanted to convert a video to grayscale. A&nbsp;video is made of hundreds or thousands of image frames. You would need to use a for-loop to iterate over the video frames and apply a grayscale effect to each frame. Another example would be to iterate over the pages of your blog website to extract their user comments, etc.</p><p><strong>Q4:&nbsp;What is the difference between match-case and if-else?</strong></p><p>Match-case is usually to match a string out of a predefined number of strings (e.g., a series of commands, months of the year, etc.).&nbsp; If-else conditionals check more complex conditions. We will cover if-else conditionals later in the course. There you will understand the exact difference.</p>
