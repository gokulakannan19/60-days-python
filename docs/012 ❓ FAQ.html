<p><strong>Q1:&nbsp;In the app, we imported <em>functions.py</em> from <em>main.py</em>. Is it possible to import <em>main.py</em> from <em>functions.py</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, that is technically possible.&nbsp;You can do <code>import main</code> in functions.py. However, that import doesn't make much sense. We usually import the backend to the frontend. The backend is the script where the processing is done (i.e., reading and writing the to-do files), and the frontend is the code that constructs the user interface (i.e., the command line).</p><p><strong>Q2:&nbsp;Can we import more than one <em>.py</em> file from the <em>main.py</em> file?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, that is possible, and as the program expands, it is recommended to create more backend files, and you can import all those files from <em>main.py. </em>For example, you might want to create some functions which send out the to-do items by email to your email address. You might also want to create some functions that produce a PDF&nbsp;with the to-do items inside. It is recommended to write the email and the PDF&nbsp;functions in separate modules and then import those modules from the main module. For example, if we had these files:</p><p><em>main.py</em></p><p><em>functions.py</em></p><p><em>pdf.py</em></p><p><em>email.py</em></p><p>In <em>main.py</em> we would have these lines:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">import functions
import pdf
import email</pre>
