<p><strong>Q1:&nbsp;I am still confused about when I&nbsp;should use a for-loop and when a list comprehension.</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;First of all, it should be clear that there is nothing that a list comprehension does that a for-loop doesn't. The opposite is not true meaning in certain cases the for-loop is the only way around.</p><p>The rule of thumb is if you can do something with a list comprehension, do it as it is less code than a for-loop. </p>
