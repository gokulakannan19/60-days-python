<p><strong>Q1:&nbsp;What are the pros and cons of if-elif-else and match-case?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;Match-case is generally faster. If you can use it, do so. However, match-case is more limited. It can only check if one value is equal to another. It cannot check if one value is less/greater than another, or other more complex conditions. For such advanced conditions, you should use if-elif-else.</p><p><strong>Q2:&nbsp;What does the </strong><code><strong>in</strong></code><strong> operator do?</strong></p><p><code>in</code> is just another operator. For example, we have the "greater-than" operator that checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">if 3 &gt; 2:
    print("Yes")</pre><p>Similarly, we have the <code>in</code> operator that checks if the value on the left is contained in the value on the right. For example:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">if "a" in "aaa":
    print("Yes")</pre><p>And we can also use it with lists to check if the list contains a certain item:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">if "a" in ["a", "b", "c"]:
    print("Yes")</pre><p>The <code>in</code> operator is also known as a "containment test", although this is a very technical term that almost no one uses. </p>
