<p><strong>Q1:&nbsp;Today, we used to call the custom functions we created using the syntax </strong><code><strong>function()</strong></code><strong>. However, certain built-in functions (e.g., </strong><code><strong>input(x)</strong></code><strong>, </strong><code><strong>print(x),</strong></code><strong> etc.)&nbsp;can be called with an argument inside the parenthesis. So, why don't custom functions get an argument as some built-in functions do?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;Custom functions can also get an argument, but that is something you will learn tomorrow. Stay tuned!</p><p><strong>Q2:&nbsp;What is the benefit of creating a function besides avoiding repetitive code?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;Another benefit of creating functions is to make your code easier to extend and reuse. Being a well-defined block of code a function is easy to copy and paste into other programs you are writing. </p><p>For example, you might have created a function that converts an image to greyscale in the Python photo editing program you have created. You can reuse that function in another program where you are processing video to convert the video frames to greyscale. </p><p>Likewise, a function can also be used in different parts of the same program. In other words, functions will keep your codebase more organized. </p><p><br></p>
