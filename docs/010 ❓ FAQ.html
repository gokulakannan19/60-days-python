<p><strong>Q1:&nbsp;I&nbsp;want to give the app to someone else to use it, but that person does not have Python installed. How can that person use the app?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;You need to convert the <em>.py</em> file into an<em> .exe</em> (for Windows users), an <em>.app</em> file (for Mac users) or a <em>.deb</em> file (for Linux users). You will learn how to do that on Day 18.</p><p><strong>Q2:&nbsp;The GUIs we are building work only as desktop programs. How can we make a web app?</strong></p><p>FreeSimpleGUI&nbsp;is only able to create desktop GUIs. To make web apps, you need to use a Python web framework. The most popular web frameworks are Django, Flask, and Streamlit. In fact, Python is way better for building web apps. We will eventually build a Todo List web app on Day 19.</p>
