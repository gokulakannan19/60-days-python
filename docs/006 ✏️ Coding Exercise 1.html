<h4>Congratulations on coming this far! That is a BIG&nbsp;achievement!</h4><p><br></p><p>Throughout the next few days, we will gradually migrate from coding exercises to a new type of activity - projects. Projects will require you to code longer scripts. Projects will finally replace coding exercises on Day 20. Today, we will have a coding exercise that looks more like a (small) project. Please read the instructions below.</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Coding Exercise 1</strong></h4><p>Your task is to create a program that generates a random <strong>whole</strong> number. Here is how the program should behave:</p><p><br></p><figure><img height="58" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2022-06-08_15-01-13-0d4f584c4b0be3313c00c7a1c1181046.png" width="256"></figure><p>As you can see, the program first asks the user to enter a whole number. Then, once the user enters a number, the program asks the user again to enter another number. </p><p>Then, the program returns a random number that falls between the two whole numbers. Here is another example:</p><figure><img height="59" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2022-06-08_15-01-13-13d000430186a7da3ff410a7d783fbdc.png" width="259"></figure><p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;To create this program, you might need to do some internet research or use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Python module index</a> to find out what <strong>module</strong> and what <strong>function</strong> of that module you can use to generate random numbers. While it is easy for me to provide some clues here on what module you should use, searching for information and becoming familiar with programming community sites such as Stackoverflow is part of the programming skillset you should acquire. Thus, it is essential to practice such skills as well so you are independent after you finish the course. </p><p><a href="https://pythonhow.com/coding/d15c1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Solution</a></p>
