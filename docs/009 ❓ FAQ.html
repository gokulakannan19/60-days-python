<p><strong>Q1:&nbsp;Why are some standard modules written in C&nbsp;and others written in Python?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;Usually, modules are prototyped in Python, but later they may be rewritten in C to speed them up. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q2:&nbsp;Are there other modules besides the ones listed on the </strong><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Python Module Index</strong></a><strong> page? </strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;The list of modules on the Python Module Index page is the complete list of <strong>standard</strong> modules. These modules come shipped with the Python interpeter. However, there are other third-party modules created by the vast Python community. Such third-party modules need to be installed first and then used. We will cover third-party modules later in the course.</p>
