<p><strong>Q1:&nbsp;When should I use </strong><code><strong>read()</strong></code><strong> and when </strong><code><strong>readlines()</strong></code><strong>?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;If you want to get all the text as one single string, use <code>read()</code>. If you want to get separate strings for each line, use <code>readlines()</code>.</p><p><strong>Q2:&nbsp;How is the with-context manager actually able to close the file when we are not including the </strong><code><strong>close()</strong></code><strong>&nbsp;method?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;The close() method is called implicitly even though we don't call it explicitly. The Python interpreter will call the method when it sees that we have written a with-context manager.</p>
