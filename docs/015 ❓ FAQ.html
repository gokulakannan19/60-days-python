<p><strong>Q1:&nbsp;Can we let the user specify the name of the text file instead of having the program use the same todos.txt name always?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;Technically, that is possible, but it would be a bad design idea. The name of the file is not a user's concern. It is a detail of the backend of the program. Asking the user to specify the text filename is like asking the customer in a cafe to choose the color of the container where the coffee beans should be placed. The container is part of the cafe backend, whereas the customer is only interested in the frontend components (i.e., the brewed coffee). </p><p><br></p>
