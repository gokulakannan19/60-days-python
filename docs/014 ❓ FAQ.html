<p><strong>Q1:&nbsp;We are storing the to-do items in a text file. What would happen if we stored them in an Excel file?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;If we worked with Excel files instead of text files, we would need to define other functions which would contain code elements that handle Excel files. It is recommended not to delete or change the existing functions but to simply add other functions in the <code>functions.py</code> file. Later in the course, we will cover how to work with Excel files as well.</p>
