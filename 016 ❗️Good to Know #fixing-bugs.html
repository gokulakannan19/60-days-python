<p><strong>What is a bug?</strong></p><p>Programmers spend around 20-40% of their time coding and 20-40% hunting and fixing bugs. Take a look at the program below:</p><p><code>print("Hello"</code></p><p>That program has a bug because when you run the program, it produces an error message. The error message in our case is this:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums"> File "/Users/as/main.py", line 1
    print("Hello"
         ^
SyntaxError: '(' was never closed</pre><p><strong>How to fix a bug</strong></p><p>As a programmer, you should carefully read the error message and try to understand it. In our particular example, the error message informs us that we forgot a parenthesis. Therefore, to fix the bug, you should add a parenthesis as follows:</p><p><code>print("Hello")</code></p><p>Run the above code, and you will see that it returns the expected output, which is&nbsp;<em>Hello</em>. That means the bug has been fixed. In the following article, you will do your first bug-fixing exercises. </p><p>Let's go!</p>
